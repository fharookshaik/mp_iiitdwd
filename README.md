## Project Description

The project focuses on the semantic role labelling of entities in harmful memes, categorizing them as heroes, villains, victims, or others. With the increasing popularity of memes and the associated rise in objectionable content, this work addresses the need for content moderation. The team achieved an F1-Score of 23.855, securing the eighth position in the Shared Task@Constraint 2022 organized by IIIT Delhi.

### Objectives

- Develop methodologies to label entities in memes as heroes, villains, victims, or others using techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentiment Analysis.
- Utilize framing techniques to analyze semantic relationships and enhance content moderation.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed frameworks with a focus on abstract entity analysis.

### Methodology
- **Dataset:** Custom dataset from the Shared Task@Constraint 2022, containing memes with labeled entities.
- **Approach:**
    - **Data Processing:** Includes preprocessing steps for meme text and image data.
    - **Prerequisites:** Utilizes VADER Sentiment (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and Wu-Palmer similarity for sentiment and semantic analysis.
  
- **Frameworks:**
    - **Framework-I:** Initial model combining NER and sentiment analysis.
    - **Framework-II:** Enhanced model with additional semantic features.
    - **Improved Framework-I and II:** Optimized versions with better performance metrics.

- **Techniques:** Framing, NER, Sentiment Analysis, and semantic similarity measures.


## Results

- Achieved an F1-Score of 23.855, ranking eighth in the competition.
- Detailed analysis of model performance across different frameworks is provided in the report.

## Conclusion & Future Enhancement

The project proposes effective approaches for role labelling in memes, though the F1-Score indicates room for improvement. Future enhancements could involve larger datasets, refined sentiment analysis, and integration of advanced NLP techniques.
